# autodungeon
 A roguelike dungeon crawler autobattler (and a genetic algorithm to optimize your character's stats)

 The folder "AUTO DUNGEON" contains a playable version of the game.

 The folder "GNA AUTO DUNGEON" contains a version which plays automatically and optimizes your character's stats.
 While it is built on the same code as the playable auto dungeon, much of the output has been commented out in the name of efficiency.

 The two are not linked to each other, so changes from one do
 not automatically translate to the other. This means the GNA
 version will not update if development continues on the playable version, but it also means that more experimentation can be done on the playable version without risk of breaking the GNA version.
